I just followed Github Docs to [create a GitHub Page site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

I saw [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) allows every account to build a site, so I was considering why I don't create my home page to introduce myself.

So, here it is! My GitHub home page!
